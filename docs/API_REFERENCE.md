# API Reference Documentation

This document provides an overview of the key classes, modules, and external APIs used in the Talos Algo AI trading system.

---

## 1. Core Modules & Classes

### `src.crew.orchestrator.TradingOrchestrator`
The main entry point for running trading cycles. It's responsible for:
- Running the `MarketScannerCrew`.
- Dispatching `TradingCrew` instances in parallel for the top assets.
- Managing the `GlobalRateLimiter`.

### `src.utils.global_scheduler.AutoTradingScheduler`
The engine for 24/7 autonomous operation. Its responsibilities include:
- Running an infinite loop to manage trading cycles.
- Using the `MarketCalendar` to check if target markets are open.
- Calling the `TradingOrchestrator` to execute a cycle.
- Persisting system state with the `StateManager`.

### `src.utils.backtester_v2.BacktesterV2`
A utility for running historical simulations of trading strategies.
- Used by the `backtest` and `compare` CLI commands.
- Implements an event-driven architecture to prevent lookahead bias.
- Models slippage and commissions for more realistic results.
- Fetches historical data and simulates trades to calculate advanced performance metrics like Sharpe Ratio, Sortino Ratio, Calmar Ratio, and Max Drawdown.

### `src.strategies` Module
This module contains the pluggable trading strategies. All strategies inherit from the `TradingStrategy` abstract base class and implement a consistent interface.
