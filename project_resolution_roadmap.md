# Talos Algo AI - Project Analysis and Resolution Roadmap (v2)

## Executive Summary

This document provides a comprehensive analysis of the Talos Algo AI trading system, identifies deviations from the original plan, diagnoses current issues, and prescribes step-by-step solutions to resolve technical debt while maintaining project objectives. This version of the roadmap has been updated to reflect the findings of a comprehensive project verification.

## Part 1: Project Objectives Analysis

### Primary Objective
Create a backend-first, CLI-driven autonomous trading system using multi-agent AI orchestration with CrewAI, Google Gemini LLM, and Alpaca Markets API, operating within free-tier constraints.

### Core Design Principles Identified
1. **Backend-First Philosophy**: Build robust CLI functionality before any UI development
2. **Modular Architecture**: Independent, testable, and replaceable components
3. **Free-Tier Operation**: Respect API rate limits and quotas
4. **Risk Management**: Portfolio-level constraints and position sizing
5. **Multi-Strategy Support**: Pluggable trading strategies beyond the original 3MA
6. **Autonomous Operation**: 24/7 market scanning and execution capability

### Current Project State vs Original Plan

#### Achievements
- Multi-agent system successfully implemented with four core agents
- Multiple trading strategies deployed beyond original 3MA specification
- Market scanner crew operational for asset discovery
- Parallel execution orchestrator functional
- Autonomous scheduler with market calendar awareness
- Comprehensive CLI interface with backtesting capabilities
- State management and global rate limiting infrastructure

#### Deviations from Original Plan
- **Simplified LLM Integration**: Advanced Gemini connector with key rotation and health tracking bypassed due to dependency conflicts
- **Basic Backtesting**: Event-driven backtester not fully implemented
- **Limited Test Coverage**: Unit tests missing for majority of new features
- **Simplified Confirmations**: Some strategy validation layers use proxy indicators rather than full implementation
- **SignalValidator Agent Removed**: Validation logic merged into strategies and SignalGenerator, reducing agent count from five to four

## Part 2: Critical Issues Diagnosis

### Issue 1: Production-Grade LLM Connector Not Operational (Resolved)
The sophisticated `GeminiConnectionManager` is now integrated into the agent creation workflow.

### Issue 2: Backtesting Engine Limitations (Resolved)
The backtester has been re-implemented as an event-driven engine.

### Issue 3: Insufficient Unit Test Coverage (Partially Resolved)
Unit test coverage is minimal across new features.

### Issue 4: Simplified Strategy Validation Logic (Resolved)
Strategy validation logic has been enhanced.

### Issue 5: Missing Agent from Original Design (Confirmed and Documented)
The `SignalValidatorAgent` is absent from the current architecture, and its responsibilities have been integrated into the `SignalGeneratorAgent` and the individual strategy classes.

### New Issue 6: Alpaca API Subscription Limitations
**Problem Description**:
The Alpaca API key in use does not have a sufficient subscription level to query recent SIP data. This prevents the system from fetching live or recent market data, causing all data-dependent operations to fail.
**Impact Severity**: CRITICAL
- The system is unable to function in a live or paper trading environment.
- All `run` commands that attempt to fetch data fail.

### New Issue 7: Ineffective API Rate Limiting
**Problem Description**:
The `GlobalRateLimiter` is not effectively preventing `429 RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED` errors from the Gemini API when running multiple crews in sequential or parallel modes.
**Impact Severity**: HIGH
- The system is unreliable when running multiple crews.
- The system is susceptible to being blocked by the API provider.

### New Issue 8: Performance Bottlenecks
**Problem Description**:
The `run --parallel`, `run --scan`, and `scan` commands all time out after 400 seconds. This indicates a significant performance issue, likely within the market scanner, that prevents these operations from completing in a reasonable amount of time.
**Impact Severity**: HIGH
- The system is not scalable.
- The market scanner is unusable in its current state.

## Part 3: Resolution Roadmap

### Phase 1: Restore Production-Grade LLM Infrastructure (Implemented)

### Phase 2: Enhance Backtesting Engine (Implemented)

### Phase 3: Comprehensive Test Coverage Implementation (Partially Implemented)
- **Next Steps:**
    - Establish testing standards.
    - Create test fixtures.
    - Mock external dependencies.
    - Write unit tests for all strategies, tools, and crews.
    - Achieve a minimum of 80% test coverage.

### Phase 4: Enhance Strategy Validation Logic (Implemented)

### Phase 5: Architecture Documentation Alignment (Implemented)

### New Phase 6: Resolve API and Performance Issues
- **Step 6.1: Address Alpaca API Subscription:**
    - The user must upgrade their Alpaca API subscription to a plan that allows for querying recent SIP data.
- **Step 6.2: Fix API Rate Limiting:**
    - Investigate the `GlobalRateLimiter` and its interaction with the `GeminiConnectionManager` to identify and fix the cause of the rate limiting failures.
- **Step 6.3: Profile and Optimize Performance:**
    - Profile the market scanner and other long-running processes to identify the source of the performance bottlenecks and implement optimizations.

3.  Complete test coverage for execution and orchestration (Phase 3, Steps 3.6-3.9)

### Medium Priority (Complete Within 8 Weeks)
4.  Production hardening implementation (Phase 6)
5.  Rate limiting and resource management refinements (Phase 7)

### Low Priority (Complete Within 12 Weeks)
6.  State management enhancements (Phase 8)
7.  Market calendar refinements (Phase 9)
8.  Full deployment infrastructure (Phase 10)

## Conclusion

This updated roadmap provides a systematic approach to resolving identified technical debt while maintaining the core objectives of the Talos Algo AI trading system. The recent project verification has highlighted critical issues with API access, rate limiting, and performance, which have been prioritized accordingly. By addressing these issues and continuing with the planned test coverage and production hardening, the system will be on a clear path to production-readiness.
